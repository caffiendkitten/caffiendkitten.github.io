# My Github Pages Profile


My name is DaNeil. I am a quality-driven security researcher and full stack software/security engineer with a passion for performing responsible disclosure, aligning security controls, processes, policies and procedures.
I take pride in my passion for Information Security and am enthusiastic about finding security vulnerabilities.

I am active within the Capture the Flag community and local tech meetup groups such as the CyberSecurity Non-Profit that I am a chapter organizer for, WISP, WoSec, and OWASP and this site will be built around my progress and my process of getting into Info Sec.
