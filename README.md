# My Github Pages Profile


My name is DaNeil. I am a quality-driven security consultant, researcher, and full stack software/security engineer with a passion for performing responsible disclosure, aligning security controls, processes, policies and procedures.<br />    
I take pride in my passion for Information Security and am enthusiastic about finding security vulnerabilities.

I am active within the CTF community and local tech meetup groups such as the CyberSecurity Non-Profit, WISP, WoSec, and OWASP.<br />

This site will be built around my progress and my process of getting into Info Sec. See it at <a href="https://caffiendkitten.github.io">caffiendkitten.github.io</a>
