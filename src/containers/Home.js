                    Experienced in leveraging tool-based testing and manual hands-on testing of web 
                    applications and network services while utilizing web and network application

                    I am passionate about Information Security and enthusiastic about finding 
                    security vulnerabilities. I am active within the Capture the Flag community 
                    and local tech meetup groups such as the CyberSecurity Non-Profit that I am a 
                    chapter organizer for, WISP, WoSec, and OWASP and this site will be built

                    I am seeking a Vulnerability Researcher / Penetration Tester position that 
                    will push my experience and skills to the limit and also offer a challenging 
                    future with room for learning and advancement.

                <p>
                I started my transition into Information Security as a Web Dev Student at LCSC. 
                From here I took an interest in Information Systems and went to City University of Seattle 
                to finish my BA. During this time I became fascinated with security started down the 
                research path of discovering bugs in code and applications. I am a highly motivated and 
                a self-taught pentesting through CTFs and Bug Bounties. While learning pentesting I 
                became a graduate of Flatiron School's intensive Immersive Fullstack Software Engineering 
                program to better understand how web applications were built while being taught to make them 
                myself. During my time at Flatiron, I had the opportunity to work both collaboratively and 
                independently to conceive and create multiple fullstack React and Ruby on Rails web applications 
                in a fast-moving, high-stress environment.
